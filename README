Simple client and server applications to send a file over home LAN network. 

Server is run from the directory where files are stored. Thats all that is required from the server side

The client application is run from the directory where download has to be stored. 

The client is run as 

python3 client.py ip_address

This will list all the files vailable with the server along with a serial number for the file.

Next the client is run as 

python3 client.py ip_address file_number

The download begins and the file is saved in the clients current directory

TODO
I can add the ability of the server to share filesize along with the list of files.
This can be further used to show dwnload progress to the client.
